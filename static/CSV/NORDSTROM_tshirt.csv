First of all, this ivory shirt is too sheer to just wear a bra under it - call me conservative. Secondly, I look like I just popped out of a 15th century romance novel wearing one of those men\'s puffy medieval shirts. Yes, you heard me right. The cinch around the waist is attractive and accentuates my waistline, but what is going on with the sleeves? They are way too puffy / flowy. Moreover, the fabric feels and looks really cheap. I usually love T&B, but this is a big NO. For reference, I\'m 5\'8, 130 lb, 36A, 29"" waist (and usually a size 6/M for tops). I ordered the Medium, which fits perfectly.', '32'], ['sleeves are oddly wide and long', 'I was excited to get this top to wear to work as well as dress down with jeans on the weekend.

I gave it 4 ⭐️’s instead of 5 because the sleeves are also just a tad too long with my arms by my sides. A little on the wrinkly side as well but not bad by any means!

I plan on wearing it to work. I think you can easily dress it up if your work is business casual or dress it down with jeans for more casual. I bought a white cami to wear underneath is since it is see through in between the stripes. But the overall quality of the material is really nice and the blouse is very comfortable.
